# Lights Out Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic "Lights Out" puzzle game built with React.

## Objective

The goal of the game is to turn all of the lights on the grid off.

## How to Play

1.  The game is played on a grid of squares, each of which can be either "on" or "off".
2.  When you click on a square, it toggles the state of that square and its adjacent (up, down, left, right) squares.
3.  To win, you must find the right combination of clicks to turn all the squares "off".
